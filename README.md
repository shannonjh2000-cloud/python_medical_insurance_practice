- creating functions
- using if statements
- making lists
- appending the lists
- joining two lists together
- finding specific information from within a list
- isolating factors and showing their consquence (e.g. the affect smoking has on the cost of medical insurance)
- stripping data to remove whitespace
- splitting data to tidy is up and make it more readable
- creating dictionaries
- calcutaing average cost
- pulling specific data from a dictionary and/or list
- deleting information from a dictionary
